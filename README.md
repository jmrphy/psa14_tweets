This repository contains the materials for scraping and analyzing tweets containing the hashtag #PSA14, from the 2014 Political Studies Conference in Manchester, UK.

The main files for reproducing the analysis are listed below.

- The R script "psa_tweets.R" contains all the code used to scrape and analyze the data.

- The file "dm_tweets.Rdata" is the original list of Twitter data scraped with the "twitteR" package.

- The file "psa_tweets.csv" is a comma-separated, plain text file containing the raw Twitter data but transformed into a traditional dataframe more convenient for analysis.

The R script "psa_tweets.R" loads each of these two files for its various analyses, see the comments in that script for more guidance.
